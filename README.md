## App Summary
> Bill calculator is a simple node app to calculate the amount you have to venmo when you and your friend go out to eat and drink. Although there are many bill split applications on the market now, it's hard to use them if some people in your group ordered expensive food or drink. You know it is not fair. 


## App Logic
> It has a really simple calculator. First, the user is asked to input the price of which they ordered. Second, the user is asked to type the state since tax rate is different. Third, at last, the user is asked what percentage of the tip they want to pay.  

## Stretch Goals
> Instead of that user enters the total of what they ordered, I can allow user to input separate items as many as they want since it may be a hassle to calculate the total.
